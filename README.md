# About Me


**VibrioidPlague/VibrioidPlague** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the linux command line and scripting in my free time.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my education in really all areas of programming and the linux/unix culture

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: His supreme sexyness super duper badass big daddy... or he/him, call me whatever, just call me...

- âš¡ Fun fact: the above snippet was a JOKE, kinda poking a little fun at the fact that our education system in the US is doing such a bang up job that you send your kid there knowing very little and get them back knowing less, how did a simple biological certainty, you know the whole XX Xy thing we used to learn about in school, which actually tells you your pronouns as they're spoken, in english at least, with no ambiguity at all, it's not an opinion, any more than the color of the sky or is water wet.  We've got real issues going on, a failing economy and untenable social policies which have proven to fail time and time again and result in dictatorships every single time throughout history, just as every time a populance has let a government disarm them it has resulted in the same, yet we've got so much of the population crying about how they want people to call them by some made up fictional pronoun, trying to force everyone to abandon actual correct grammer to appease their feelings of inadequacy. We need to deal with the underlying self esteem problems in our society rather than axacerbating them and catering to crazy people, in my opinion.  A biological fact is a biological fact, just like if I'm missing my leg, you telling me I really do have a leg isn't going to change the fact, although it may make me believe I do have a leg if I'm gaslighted enough, but what happens when I try to stand on that missing leg? I'll fall, what do you think is happening to these people who aren't getting their underlying problems dealt with, rather, being catered to instead? Well schools get invaded or these kids simply off themselves, it's doing them a great disservice, taking a teenager who's confused and uncomfortable in their body, which is basically all of them, and convincing them it's because they're the wrong gender, and not that feeling awkard and gangly is a part of growing up borders on criminal in my opinion. I'm sorry if it offends you, it's not meant to, I love each and every one of my human brothers and sisters and I want us all to live and thrive together, so how could I in good faith lie to you about my opinions?
